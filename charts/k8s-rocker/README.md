# k8s Rocker
A general purpose kubernetes chart.
The chart takes an oppinionated approach and is geared towards running microservices.

This is more or less the second evolution of the yaml rocker.
It's kubernetes native only (no openshift dependencies)

## Features
Every top level block is optional.
This means you can use the chart to simplky deploy a couple of config maps or a full fledged app with multiple containers.

# How To
See the [example](example.yaml) file.
